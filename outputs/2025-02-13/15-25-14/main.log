[2025-02-13 15:25:14,729][flwr][WARNING] - 
Setting `min_available_clients` lower than `min_fit_clients` or
`min_evaluate_clients` can cause the server to fail when there are too few clients
connected to the server. `min_available_clients` must be set to a value larger
than or equal to the values of `min_fit_clients` and `min_evaluate_clients`.

[2025-02-13 15:25:24,185][flwr][ERROR] - Your simulation crashed :(. This could be because of several reasons. The most common are: 
	 > Sometimes, issues in the simulation code itself can cause crashes. It's always a good idea to double-check your code for any potential bugs or inconsistencies that might be contributing to the problem. For example: 
		 - You might be using a class attribute in your clients that hasn't been defined.
		 - There could be an incorrect method call to a 3rd party library (e.g., PyTorch).
		 - The return types of methods in your clients/strategies might be incorrect.
	 > Your system couldn't fit a single VirtualClient: try lowering `client_resources`.
	 > All the actors in your pool crashed. This could be because: 
		 - You clients hit an out-of-memory (OOM) error and actors couldn't recover from it. Try launching your simulation with more generous `client_resources` setting (i.e. it seems {'num_cpus': 2, 'num_gpus': 0.5} is not enough for your run). Use fewer concurrent actors. 
		 - You were running a multi-node simulation and all worker nodes disconnected. The head node might still be alive but cannot accommodate any actor with resources: {'num_cpus': 2, 'num_gpus': 0.5}.
Take a look at the Flower simulation examples for guidance <https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-run-simulations.html>.
